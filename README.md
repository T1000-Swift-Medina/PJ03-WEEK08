# Project 3

### Overview:

Your team will be creating a iOS application.

Use your imagination! You get to create whatever you want for this app. Though, you'll need to run your user stories, and wireframes, by your instructors to get their feedback and approval before you begin coding! Remember to keep things small and focus on mastering the fundamentals as scope creep/feature creep is the biggest pitfall for any project!

Identify what you need to build and accomplish to meet project expectations and identify everything else as stretch goals. If you meet your MVP \(Minimum Viable Product\) ahead of schedule, you can decide which remaining goals to focus on for the remainder of your time.

**You will be working as a team for this project**, everyone must contribute on a team. If 1 person does not contribute or 1 person does all the work then the entire team will fail the project requirements. If you pair program then please include the other persons GitHub name in the commit.

#### Stretch Goals

* Use a 3rd party API

#### Team Requirements

* Every team member must have commits contributing to the project.
* Pair programming is allowed and should be noted in the commit by using @github\_username of each developer pairing

#### Necessary Deliverables

Projects are due **Thursday, 30/11/2021 at 1:00 PM**!

Submissions will be submitted by posting into a Google Sheet
